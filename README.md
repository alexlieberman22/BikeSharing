## Summary
Rides for CitiBike tend to be short and most used in the very popular and populated areas of NYC at busy times of day. Male Subscibers are the majority of users for the program, however other trends are largely the same regardless fo gender. Bike share programs like CityBike are more likely to do well in city centers or densely populated areas were getting around by bike is easier and more convinent then by car. I would be interested to see trends by Age insted of gender and by ride distance instead of time.
